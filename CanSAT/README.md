# CanSat

A project for ESERO CanSat competiton.  
The goal was to create a small satellite the size of a soda can. It was a team of project, we were a team of 4(I was responsible for programming and partially 3D design). 
Our sattelite was able to measure temperature, pressure, air pollution, report its GPS location, gyro position and acceleration, radioactive decay intensity in the atmosphere.  
The can was designed in Solidworks, the tube was 3D printed and the caps were made using CNC machine. The can couldn't excess a certain weight so that it would parachute with correct speed after being released from a rocket.  
Communication with the can was possible thanks to LORA radio modules and our antennas, we managed to achieve the range of around 9 km.
