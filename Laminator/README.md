# Laminator

I was looking for a way to thermotransfer my PCB designs to copper boards, and I stumbled upon an article where somebody explained that 
they used a laminator to achieve that. I really liked the idea but it turned out to not work very well, the reason was that boards would go through
the laminator way too fast, so they weren't able to heat up enough for the transfer to happen. So I made an extension for the laminator that(when turned on with a button) lowers the speed at which the board is being pushed through the rollers.  
With that extension, the transfer was performed perfectly every single time, which extremely sped up my future PCB production process.
